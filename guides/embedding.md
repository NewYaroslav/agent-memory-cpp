# Embeddings

## Direction

Embedding generation is a first-class project boundary. Keep the public API
backend-independent and implement concrete providers as optional adapters.

Do not fork `cpp-llamalib` to retrofit embedding support. It can be useful as a
reference for small RAII wrappers around `llama.cpp`, but chat/generation
wrappers are not the right public abstraction for embeddings. Embedding models
need explicit handling of batch inputs, pooling, normalization, vector
dimensions, model metadata, and query-vs-document usage.

## Contract First

Add dependency-free embedding contracts under `src/agent_memory/embedding/`
before adding any concrete backend. The contracts should be usable by storage,
indexing, and retrieval code without including ONNX Runtime, `llama.cpp`, HTTP
clients, or Python headers.

The contract layer should model:

- embedding vector values and dimensions;
- model identifier and limits;
- similarity metric expected by the model;
- whether returned vectors are normalized;
- embedding purpose, such as query, document, or symmetric text embedding.

The current dependency-free contract types are:

- `Embedding`;
- `EmbeddingRequest`;
- `EmbeddingModelInfo`;
- `EmbeddingPurpose`;
- `SimilarityMetric`;
- `PoolingMode`;
- `IEmbedder`.

## Backends

Concrete backends should live behind adapter boundaries, for example:

- `LlamaCppEmbedder` for local `llama.cpp` embedding models;
- `OnnxRuntimeEmbedder` for local ONNX Runtime models;
- `OpenAICompatibleEmbedder` for HTTP-compatible embedding APIs;
- user-provided implementations of the embedding interface.

Each backend must keep its dependency wiring optional and must not leak backend
types into dependency-free contracts.

## Vector Storage And Math

Keep `Embedding::values` as `std::vector<float>`. It is the portable storage
format used by serialization, MDBX adapters, tests, APIs, and exact reranking.

Do not replace the public embedding vector with `Eigen::VectorXf`. If Eigen is
added later, use it behind optional math or retrieval adapters through
temporary `Eigen::Map` views over `Embedding::values`.

Generic lossless compression such as Zstd is useful for text and cold storage,
but it should not be the hot-path representation for vector search. Future
vector storage reductions should be modeled as separate encodings such as
float16, int8, binary signatures, or product quantization, while full float
embeddings remain available for final ranking.
