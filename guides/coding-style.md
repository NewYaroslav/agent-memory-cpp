# Coding Style

## Scope

These rules apply to C++ sources, headers, examples, tests, CMake files, and
project documentation. Prefer the local style in nearby files when it is more
specific.

## Naming

- Class, struct, and enum names use `PascalCase`.
- Methods and free functions use `snake_case`.
- Private and protected data members use `m_` plus `snake_case`.
- Boolean variables should start with `is`, `has`, `use`, or `enable`.
- Enum values use `PascalCase`.
- Public/configuration macros use the `AGENT_MEMORY_` prefix.

Getter methods may omit `get_` when they behave like property accessors, such as
`size()` or `empty()`. Use `get_` when the method performs computation or when
omitting the prefix would be misleading.

## File Names

- If a file contains one primary class, use `PascalCase`, for example
  `LibraryInfo.hpp`.
- If a file contains helpers, utilities, or aggregate includes, use
  `snake_case` or a clear aggregate name.
- Keep `.hpp` and `.cpp` files side by side under `src/`.

## Include Guards

- Use `#pragma once` and a non-reserved include guard for project-owned `.hpp`
  and `.h` headers.
- Guard names use `AGENT_MEMORY_HEADER_<PATH>_<FILE>_<EXT>_INCLUDED`.
- Examples:
  - `AGENT_MEMORY_HEADER_AGENT_MEMORY_HPP_INCLUDED`;
  - `AGENT_MEMORY_HEADER_CORE_LIBRARY_INFO_HPP_INCLUDED`;
  - `AGENT_MEMORY_HEADER_STORAGE_MDBX_STORAGE_HPP_INCLUDED`.
- Keep implementation fragments such as `.ipp` unguarded if they are included
  from guarded headers.
- Public/configuration macros should not reuse include-guard names.

## Includes

- In `.cpp` files, include the matching project header first.
- Keep project headers before external or standard library headers.
- Public project headers must not include dependencies through parent-directory
  paths such as `../` or `../../`. Use the public include root instead, for
  example `#include <agent_memory/domain.hpp>`.
- User-facing code should prefer top-level or subdomain aggregate headers such
  as `<agent_memory.hpp>` or `<agent_memory/index.hpp>`.
- Prefer subdomain/domain aggregate headers for cross-module public
  dependencies when a leaf header does not need a single narrow type.
- Leaf public headers may be included directly by implementation files and
  focused tests, but keep their cross-domain includes narrow. Use forward
  declarations plus the smallest required public header when a type is only
  used by reference or pointer in the header.
- `agent_memory_header_self_sufficiency_test` compiles every public header as
  the first include in its own translation unit; update or extend that test
  when changing public include conventions.
- Do not use `using namespace` in headers or implementation files.

## Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Keep opening braces on the same line for namespaces, classes, functions, and
  control blocks.
- Keep lines around 100-120 columns where practical.
- Prefer simple control flow over clever expressions.

## Comments And Doxygen

- All comments and Doxygen text must be in English.
- Prefer `///` Doxygen comments for public APIs.
- Avoid comments that restate the code.
- Add comments for non-obvious constraints, invariants, dependency boundaries,
  ownership rules, or algorithmic choices.

Use this tag order when a public API needs detailed documentation:

```text
\brief
\tparam
\param
\return
\throws
\pre
\post
\invariant
\complexity
\thread_safety
\note / \warning
```

## Tests

- Test names should describe the behavior under test.
- Avoid magic literals in tests when the value has domain meaning.
- Keep smoke tests small; add focused tests when real domain behavior appears.
